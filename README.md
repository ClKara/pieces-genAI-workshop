# Project Overview

This repository showcases a simple yet interactive single-page HTML application created using the Pieces for Developers AI tool. The application features a button that, when clicked, dynamically changes the displayed text on the page. This project serves as a demonstration of how to leverage AI tools to streamline web development processes and enhance user interactivity. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or use it as a foundation for your own projects!
